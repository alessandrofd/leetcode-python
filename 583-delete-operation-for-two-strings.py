        Approach #1 Using Longest Common Subsequence [Time Limit Exceeded]

        In order to determine the minimum number of delete operations needed, we can
        make use of the length of the longest common sequence among the two given
        strings s1 and s2, say given by lcs. If we can find this lcs value, we can
        easily determine the required result as m + n - 2*lcs. Here, m and n refer to
        the length of the two given strings s1 and s2.

        The above equation works because in case of complete mismatch(i.e. if the two
        strings can't be equalized at all), the total number of delete operations
        required will be m + n. Now, if there is a common sequence among the two
        strings of length lcs, we need to do lcs lesser deletions in both the strings
        leading to a total of 2lcs lesser deletions, which then leads to the above
        equation.

        In order to find the length of the longest common sequence, we make use of a
        recursive function lcs(s1,s2,i,j) which returns the length of the longest
        common sequence among the strings s1 and s2 considering their lengths upto i
        and j respectively. For evaluating the function, we check if the characters
        s1[m-1] and s2[n-1] for equality. If they match, we can consider the
        corresponding strings upto 1 lesser lengths since the last characters have
        already been considered and add 1 to the result to be returned for strings of
        1 lesser lengths. Thus, we make the function call lcs(s1, s2, i-1, j-1).

        If the last characters don't match, we have two options, either we can
        consider the second last character of s1 and the last character of 2s2, or we
        can consider the second last character of s2 and the last character of s1. We
        need to consider the larger result obtained out of the two considerations for
        getting the required length.

        Thus, the function call lcs(s1,s2,m,n) returns the required lcs value.

        Approach #3 Using Longest Common Subsequence- Dynamic Programming [Accepted]

        Another method to obtain the value of lcslcslcs is to make use of Dynamic
        Programming. We'll look at the implemenation and carry-on alongside the idea
        behind it.

        We make use of a 2-D dp, in which dp[i][j] represents the length of the
        longest common subsequence among the strings s1 and s2 considering their
        lengths upto (i−1)th index and (j−1)th index only respectively. We fill the
        dp array in row-by-row order.

        In order to fill the entry for dp[i][j], we can have two cases:

        The characters s1[i−1] and s2[j-1] match with each other. In this case,
        the entry for dp[i][j] will be one more than the entry obtained for the
        strings considering their lengths upto one lesser index, since the matched
        character adds one to the length of LCS formed till the current indices.
        Thus, the dp[i][j] entry is updated as dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]. Note
        that dp[i-1][j-1] has been used because the matched character belongs to
        both s1 and s2.

        The characters s1[i−1] and s2[j−1] don't match with each other. In this
        case, we can't increment the current entry as compared to entries
        corresponding to the previous indices, but we need to replicate the
        previous entry again to indicate that the length of LCS upto the current
        indices also remains the same. But, which entry to pick up? Now, since the
        current character hasn't matched, we have got two options. We can remove
        the current character from consideration from either s1 or s2 and use the
        corresponding dp entries given by dp[i−1][j] and dp[i][j−1] respectively.
        Since we are considering the length of LCS upto the current indices we
        need to pick up the larger entry out of these two to update the current dp
        entry.

        At the end, again, we obtain the number of deletions required as
        m + n - 2*dp[m][n], where m and n refer to the lengths of s1 and s2.
        dp[m][n] now refers to the length of LCS among the two given strings.

        Approach #4 Without using LCS Dynamic Programmming [Accepted]:

        Instead of finding the length of LCS and then determining the number of
        deletions required, we can make use of Dynamic Programming to directly
        determine the number of deletions required till the current indices of the
        strings.

        In order to do so, we make use of a 2-D dp array. Now, dp[i][j] refers to the
        number of deletions required to equalize the two strings if we consider the
        strings' length upto (i−1)th index and (j−1)th index for s1 and s2
        respectively. Again, we fill in the dp array in a row-by-row order. Now, in
        order to fill the entry for dp[i][j], we need to consider two cases only:

        The characters s1[i−1] and s2[j−1] match with each other. In this case, we
        need to replicate the entry corresponding to dp[i−1][j−1] itself. This is
        because, the matched character doesn't need to be deleted from any of the
        strings.

        The characters s1[i−1] and s2[j−1] don't match with each other. In this
        case, we need to delete either the current character of s1 or s2. Thus, an
        increment of 1 needs to be done relative to the entries corresponding to
        the previous indices. The two options available at this moment are
        dp[i−1][j]d and dp[i][j−1]. Since, we are keeping track of the minimum
        number of deletions required, we pick up the minimum out of these two
        values.

        At the end, dp[m][n] gives the required minimum number of deletions. Here,
        m and n refer to the lengths of s1 and s2.

        We can observe that in the last approach, in order to update the current dp
        entries, we need only the values of the previous row of dp. Thus, rather than
        using a 2-D array, we can do the same job by making use of a 1-D dp array.

        Thus, now, dp[i] refers to the number of deletions that need to be made in
        order to equalize the strings s1 and s2 if we consider string s1 upto the
        (i−1)th index and string s2 upto the last to current index of s2.

        Now, we make the updations for the current row in an array temp of the same
        size as dp, and use the dp entries as if they correspond to the previous
        row's entries. When, the whole temp array has been filled, we copy it the dp
