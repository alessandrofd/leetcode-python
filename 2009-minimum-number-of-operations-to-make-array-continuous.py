"""
You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can replace any
element in nums with any integer.

nums is considered continuous if both of the following conditions are
fulfilled:

    All elements in nums are unique.

    The difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in nums
    equals nums.length - 1.

For example, nums = [4, 2, 5, 3] is continuous, but nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is
not continuous.

Return the minimum number of operations to make nums continuous.

Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Topics: Array, Binary Search

Hints:

    Sort the array.

    For every index do a binary search to get the possible right end of the
    window and calculate the possible answer.

        Approach 1: Binary Search

        The problem description gives some rules for what a continuous array is,
        but we can simplify it to help us better understand the problem.
        A continuous array covers all the elements in a range of size n.
        Essentially, if we sort a continuous array, it will continuously count up
        by 1.

        We can define a continuous array by giving its bounds - left and right.
        For example, in the following continuous array:

            [6, 3, 5, 4]

        The bounds are left = 3 and right = 6. As you can see, the array fully
        covers all elements in the range [3, 6]. If we were to sort it, we would
        get [3, 4, 5, 6], which starts at left and counts up by 1 until we reach
        right.

        To solve this problem, we will iterate over the array and treat each
        element as left. We can then calculate right = left + n - 1. We now want to
        convert the array into a continuous array that covers all elements in the
        range [left, right]. How many operations do we need to accomplish this?

        We need to find how many elements in the array are already in the range
        [left, right]. We can leave these elements unchanged and fill in the rest
        of the range using operations. Note that if there are duplicate elements
        in the input, this strategy will not work properly. For example, let's say
        we had the following input:

            6, 3, 3, 5, 4

        If we had left = 3, we would have right = 7. Every element in the input is
        in the range [3, 7], so it appears that we don't need any operations.
        However, the number 7 is missing because we have 3 twice. Thus, we should
        first convert nums into a set to get rid of duplicate numbers.

        Now that we have gotten rid of the duplicates, how can we quickly find how
        many elements in the array are in a given range [left, right]? If the array
        is sorted, then we can binary search to efficiently find how many elements
        are less than or equal to right. We already know how many elements are less
        than left because we treat left = nums[i] during iteration.

        Let's summarize the algorithm with an example.

            n = 8, [15, 4, 2, 44, 7, 12, 3, 2]

        First, we remove duplicates from the array, then sort it. Note the original
        length before removing duplicates as n = 8.

            n = 8, [2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 44]

        Now, we iterate over the array. For each index i, we treat left = nums[i].

            n = 8, [2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 44], left = 2

        If we were to create a continuous array with left = 2 as the minimum, we
        would need a maximum of right = left + n - 1 = 9.

            n = 8, [2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 44], left = 2, right = 9
            We need to cover the range [2, 9]

        How many operations do we need? We start by finding how many elements in
        the array are already in the desired range [left, right]. Binary search to
        find the insertion index of right. Note that the binary search here is
        finding the index after the greatest element less than or equal to right.

            n = 8, [2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 44], left = 2, right = 9
            From binary search we find an insertion index of 4 - nums[4] = 12

        Let's call this index j. We have j as the index of the first element that
        falls outside our range due to it being too large. We also have i as the
        index of the first element in our range. Thus, we can calculate the number
        of elements already in our range as j - i.

            n = 8, [2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 44], left = 2, right = 9, i = 0, j = 4
            There are 4 elements in our range [2, 9]. We need to perform
            4 operations.

        As you can see, we have 4 elements already in the range [left, right].
        Thus, these elements do not need to be changed. As we must construct an
        array of length 8, we require 8 - 4 = 4 operations (one for each other
        element) to create a continuous array if we treat 2 as the minimum.

        We can repeat this process for every index in the sorted, duplicate-free
        array. For example, if we treat nums[3] = 7 as the minimum, then our range
        is [7, 14]. We can binary search to find j and then calculate j - i = 2 as
        the number of elements already in our range. Thus, we need to perform
        8 - 2 = 6 operations if we treat 7 as the minimum.

            n = 8, [2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 15, 44], left = 7, right = 14, i = 3, j = 5
            There are 2 elements (7, 12) in the range [7, 14]. We need to perform
            6 operations.

        As we iterate over all indices and perform the above process, we keep track
        of the minimum operations needed.

        """
        Approach 2: Sliding Window

        In the previous approach, we locked in an element uniques[i] as left,
        calculated right, then found the insertion index of right as j. We used an
        O(log n) binary search to find j, but we can do better using a sliding
        window.

        Because uniques is sorted:

            As i increases, so does left = uniques[i].

            An increase in the lower bound left means an increase in the upper bound
            right as well.

            As right increases, j either remains the same or increases.

            Thus, as i increases, j will stay the same or increase.

        We initialize j = 0 and follow the same process as in the last approach.
        Iterate i over the indices of uniques and treat each left = uniques[i] as
        the minimum element. This gives us right = uniques[i] + n - 1 as our
        maximum element.

        How do we update j? Similar to the last approach, we have j as the index of
        the first element out of our range. Thus, we increment j until it points to
        an element out of our range. The condition for this is:

            while (uniques[j] < uniques[i] + n)

        Once this condition is broken, uniques[j] is out of our range [left, right]
        and correctly positioned. We can calculate the number of elements already
        in our range as j - i just like in the previous approach.

        Because j starts at 0 and cannot exceed the length of newNums, it will only
        be incremented at most n times across the entire algorithm. This means it
        costs O(1) amortized to calculate j, an improvement from the O(log ⁡n)
        binary search.
