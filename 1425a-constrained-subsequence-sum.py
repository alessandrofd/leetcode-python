"""
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the maximum sum of a
non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive
integers in the subsequence, nums[i] and nums[j], where i < j, the condition
j - i <= k is satisfied.

A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements
(can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their
original order.

Constraints:
    1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
    -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Overview:

Before we start developing a strategy, we must carefully understand what the
problem is asking for.

We need to maximize the sum of a subsequence. We can take as many integers as
we want, but the primary constraint is that we cannot have a gap of k or more
in our subsequence.

You may immediately notice that in an array of positive integers, we should
always take the entire array. The tricky part comes in when we have negative
integers. Of course, we would prefer to avoid negative integers since they
will decrease our sum. However, it may be worth taking a negative integer as
a sort of "bridge". Take a look at the following example:

    [16, -13, -5, -10, 4, 3, 9], k = 2

In this example, we have a group of negative numbers separating a 16 and a
group of positive numbers that sum to 16. We would like to take all the
positive numbers while avoiding the negative numbers, but we aren't allowed
to as that would result in a gap of three numbers. As k = 2, the biggest gap
we can have is one number. The optimal solution here is to take the -5.

As you can see, the -5 acts as a bridge for the positive numbers. The
question now is, how do we know when it is worth it to take negative numbers?
In this case, taking the -5 allowed us to take the first element of 16. This
results in a net gain of 11. Anytime we have a positive net gain, we should
consider taking this element because it can contribute to a positive sum and
potentially increase the sum of subsequent subsequences.

        Approach 1: Heap/Priority Queue

        We will iterate over the input from left to right. At each index i, we will
        consider the maximum possible sum of a subsequence that includes and ends
        at nums[i]. Let's call this value curr. How do we calculate curr for a
        given index i? We want the maximum possible sum of a subsequence that ends
        within the last k indices. We will then add nums[i] to this sum.

        We could solve this using dynamic programming - let dp[i] represent the
        maximum possible sum of a subsequence that includes and ends at nums[i].
        We can calculate dp[i] by taking the maximum dp[j] for all j in the range
        [i - k, i - 1] (the last k indices), then adding nums[i] to it.

        However, we would be iterating up to k times to calculate each state.
        As k can be large, this approach is too slow. We need a faster way to find
        the maximum dp[j] for all indices j in the range [i - k, i - 1].

        Because we are only concerned with the maximum sum, we could use a max heap.
        The max heap would store dp[j] for all j in the last k indices. We can
        easily calculate curr by simply checking the top of this heap.

        We need to make sure we don't use elements of the heap that are more than k
        away from the current index. Before we calculate curr, we pop from the top
        of the heap if it is outside our range. This means each entry in the heap
        will also need its associated index, so we can tell when an element is out
        of range.

        Note that if the top of the heap is negative, it is better to not take it.
        This is a process very similar to Kadane's Algorithm, which solves the
        Maximum Subarray problem. When the top of the heap is negative, it
        indicates that selecting this subsequence would result in a sum less than 0.
        Every element in the array to the left of the current index should be
        abandoned - any "bridge" would not be worth taking. It's better to discard
        these subsequences altogether and reset the sum to 0.

        Approach 2: TreeMap-Like Data Structure

        As we saw in the previous approach, the crux of the dynamic programming
        idea was finding the maximum value of dp in the last k indices. We
        accomplished this in O(log⁡ n) time with a heap, but we could achieve
        O(log ⁡k) with a tree map data structure (like a red-black tree). Because
        k <= n, this is a slight improvement in terms of big O.

        Let's actually use the dp array that we spoke of in the previous approach
        this time. We will have a data structure window that holds all values of dp
        in the last k indices. We can easily calculate dp[i] as nums[i] plus the
        maximum value in window. Then, we can add dp[i] to window.

        To maintain window, once we reach index k, we need to start removing
        dp[i - k] from window at each iteration.

            In Java, we will use TreeMap. Each key will be a value in dp which we
            will map to its frequency. To remove dp[i - k] from the window, we will
            decrement its frequency, and if its frequency becomes 0, we will delete
            the key.

            In C++, we will use std::map, which functions similarly to Java's
            TreeMap.

            In Python, we will use sortedcontainers.SortedList, which is more like a
            list than a map, but still provides us with the efficient operations we
            require.

            OBS: Javascript não tem um mapa ordernado. Fica o dever de casa :)

        For all implementations, we will initialize window with a key of 0 to make
        the code cleaner, otherwise we would need to handle the first index
        differently (check if window is empty before accessing the maximum key).

        The answer to the problem will be the max value in dp in the end.

    def constrainedSubsetSum_monotonic_deque(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        Approach 3: Monotonic Deque

        This approach is very similar to the solution to Sliding Window Maximum.
        We recommend you try this problem as well if you haven't already.

        Is it possible to find the maximum value of dp in the last k indices in
        O(1)? Yes, by using a monotonic queue!

        A monotonic data structure is one where the elements are always sorted. If
        we have a monotonic decreasing data structure, then the elements are always
        sorted descending. Thus, if we can maintain a monotonic data structure that
        holds values of dp for the last k indices, then the first element in this
        data structure will be the value we are interested in.

        To maintain this data structure, we need to make sure that whenever we push
        a new element, it will be the smallest value. Before we push an element
        dp[i], we check the last element. If it is less than dp[i], we must pop it,
        otherwise, the monotonic property would be broken. Since there may be
        multiple elements less than dp[i], we need to use a while loop to "clean"
        the data structure before pushing dp[i].

        Only once there are no elements in the data structure less than dp[i] will
        we push dp[i]. Additionally, we will only push positive values of dp[i] to
        queue.

        The reason we want to remove elements that are less than dp[i] is because
        dp[i] comes after those elements. Thus, those elements will be out of range
        before dp[i], and because dp[i] is greater than them, there is no chance
        those elements will ever be the maximum value in the last k indices anymore.

        Before we check the max value, we must make sure it is not out of range.
        If it is, we will remove this invalid max value. As you can see, we need to
        remove elements from both the front and the back. Thus, we will use a deque
        (double-ended queue) as our data structure.

        To detect if the max value is out of range, we must store the indices in
        the queue.

            To check if the max value is out of range, we check if
            i - queue.front() > k.

            To obtain the max value of the queue, we check dp[queue.front()]

            To obtain the value at the end of the queue, we check dp[queue.back()]

        Note that we could also store pairs (dp[i], i) on the queue.
