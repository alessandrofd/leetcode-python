        """
        Approach 1: Binary Search

        The score of a subarray is its length multiplied by its minimum element.
        In this problem, we must find the maximum score of all subarrays that
        contain nums[k].

        How can we improve our score? When we take more elements we increase the
        length of the subarray, which helps the score. However, we may find new
        minimums, which would decrease our score.

        We can start by separating the array - numbers to the left of k and numbers
        to the right of k (and including k).

        Notice that k is the meeting point of these sections. If we want to take
        elements in the left section, we start from the end of the left section and
        move toward the beginning. If we want to take elements in the right section,
        we start from the beginning and move toward the end.

        Of course, each element we take will increase our length by 1. But how will
        it affect our minimum? To compute this quickly, we can create new arrays
        for each section. These arrays will represent the minimum element we have
        seen in the section if we started from k.

            [1, 4, 3, 7, 4, 5], k = 3
            left = [1, 4, 3], right = [ 7, 4, 5]

        In the above example, let's say that we took two elements from the left
        section. We can quickly see that the minimum element from the left section
        is 3 using these arrays. Similarly, if we took all elements from the right
        section, we could quickly see that the minimum element from the right
        section is 4.

        Now that we have these arrays, how can we solve the problem? Because
        nums[k] is in the right section, we will iterate over the entire right
        section and try to take each element. Let's say we take some number of
        elements from the right section, and the minimum is x. How many elements
        can we take from the left section without changing x as the minimum? We
        must only take elements from the left that are greater than or equal to x.

        Let's switch to another example. For a given array, assuming we have
        already built the left and right arrays using the previous method.

            right = [12, 5, 5, 5, 1]
            If we take 4 elements ([12, 5, 5, 5]), the minimum is 5. How many
            elements can we take from the left section?

            left = [2, 4, 7, 7]
            We can take two elements ([7, 7]) withou changing the minimum.

        In the above example, let's say that we take four elements from the right
        section. The minimum is 5. How many elements can we take from the left
        section without changing the minimum? Two. This gives us a total size of
        4 + 2 = 6, and a total score of 6 * 5 = 30.

        How do we quickly find the number of elements we can take from the left
        section? Note that when we are building the array left from right to left,
        each time we go left we encounter a new number that is only likely to lower
        the minimum value, and the further to the left we go, the smaller the
        minimum value becomes, i.e., left is already sorted from smallest to
        largest. Therefore, we can perform a binary search to identify how many
        elements we can take.

        This brings us to our solution. We iterate with j over each index of right
        and assign currMin = right[j], which represents the minimum of our subarray.
        We then perform a binary search to find i, the insertion index of currMin
        in left. Once we have i, we can calculate the size of our subarray, and
        thus the score. We take the maximum of all scores.

        Because the right section starts at index k, its indices are offset by k
        from the real indices. Thus, in the original array, right[j] points to
        index k + j. The left section is not offset at all, so i is correctly
        positioned. The size of a subarray bounded by [left, right] is
        right - left + 1. Thus, the size of our subarray [i, k + j] is
        (k + j) - i + 1. We can multiply this by right[j] to calculate our score.

        You may have noticed: this algorithm assumes that in the optimal subarray,
        the minimum value is in the right section. But what if this assumption is
        wrong, and its actually in the left section? We can check the left section
        by simply reversing the array and then applying the same algorithm to it.
        Note that when we reverse the array, k will change. After reversal, the
        original k will be at nums.length - k - 1.

    def maximumScore_monotonic_stack(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        Approach 2: Monotonic Stack

        In this approach, we will use a similar idea as in the previous approach.
        For a given index i, if we treat nums[i] as the minimum element, we need to
        know how many elements we can take on the left and right such that we do
        not take any elements less than nums[i].

        Essentially, we need to know how far away the next lesser element is on
        both sides. If we have this information for all indices, we can quickly
        calculate the maximum score possible by treating every nums[i] as the
        minimum, since in the optimal solution, one of the indices must be the
        minimum.

        There is a very similar problem called Next Greater Element. The logic is
        identical, except that we are looking for the next smaller element. We can
        accomplish this using a monotonic stack.

        We will create an array left, where left[i] has the index of the first
        element to the left of i that has a lower value in nums than nums[i].

        Similarly, we will create an array right where right[i] has the index of
        the first element to the right of i that has a lower value in nums than
        nums[i].

        So how do we calculate right? Let's say that we are iterating over nums
        from the left and we have a chain of increasing numbers:

            [3, 6, 8, 12, 52, 335, 1, ...]

        As you can see in the example, we have 6 increasing numbers, and then a 1
        that is less than all of them. This 1 (at index 6) should be the value of
        right for all the indices of the increasing numbers. If we maintain a
        monotonic increasing stack, then this 1 will cause all those numbers to be
        popped out.

        With a monotonic increasing stack, whenever we see an element that is
        smaller than the top of the stack, it is guaranteed to be the first smaller
        element for the element at the top of the stack. This is exactly what we
        are looking for.

        To calculate left, we use the exact same process, except we iterate
        backward starting from the end of nums.

        Note that because we need to remember what indices to update when we pop
        from the stack, we will store indices on the stack instead of the elements
        themselves. We can easily find the values by referencing nums.

        Note that because we need to remember what indices to update when we pop
        from the stack, we will store indices on the stack instead of the elements
        themselves. We can easily find the values by referencing nums.

        Once we have left and right, we can iterate over all indices i and try to
        find a maximum score. Remember that the subarray must contain index k.
        Thus, we can only use an index i as the minimum if left[i] < k and
        right[i] > k.

        When we treat an index i as the minimum, what score can we achieve? Our
        window starts one index after left[i] because including left[i] would
        create a new minimum. Similarly, our window ends one index before right[i].
        Thus, we need to subtract 2 from the normal subarray size formula.
        his gives us a subarray size of right[i] - left[i] - 1. We multiply this
        size by nums[i] to get our score.

        return 0

    def maximumScore_greedy(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        Approach 3: Greedy

        Sometimes the simplest approach is the best! The optimal subarray must
        contain index k, so it makes sense to consider the subarray with only
        nums[k] as a starting point.

        From here, how do we expand the subarray? We can either add an element to
        the left or an element to the right. Let's say we have two pointers, left
        and right that represent our subarray. Which direction should we go?

        If we move left, it's equivalent to adding nums[left - 1] to our subarray.
        If we move right, it's equivalent to adding nums[right + 1] to our
        subarray. We should move in the direction of the greater element.

        At each step, we update currMin which is initially set to nums[k], and try
        to update ans which is also initially set to nums[k]. We can update ans
        with currMin * (right - left + 1) if it is larger.

        This greedy process is very similar to the one used to solve Container With
        Most Water. But why does it work? We will use a proof by contradiction to
        demonstrate that not doing it this way wouldn't result in a higher value
        either.

        At each step, we choose between having our subarray as [left - 1, right] or
        [left, right + 1]. Let's assume that nums[left - 1] > nums[right + 1] and
        the optimal subarray has not been found yet. The optimal subarray must
        include nums[left - 1]. If it doesn't, then it must include
        nums[right + 1], since we could only move right to "avoid" nums[left - 1].
        However, any subarray that includes nums[right + 1] could also include
        nums[left - 1] without affecting the minimum, while also increasing the
        length of the subarray and thus the score. Thus, it is impossible for the
        optimal subarray to include nums[right + 1] and not nums[left - 1], and in
        general the optimal subarray must include nums[left - 1].
