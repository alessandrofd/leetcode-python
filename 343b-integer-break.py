        Approach 1: Top-Down Dynamic Programming

        Let's say we have an integer num and split it into two integers: i and
        num - i. The highest product possible would be i * BEST, where BEST is the
        highest product possible from splitting up num - i.

        Notice that the variable BEST represents the original problem with a
        different input (num - i). This allows us to think in terms of dynamic
        programming. Let's define a function dp(num) that returns the highest
        possible product from splitting num up.

        We have the following base cases for this function:

            If num == 1, then it isn't possible to split the number up, so we just
            return 1.

            If num == 2, then it would be better to not split the number at all,
            since the only possible split 1 * 1 is less than 2, so just return 2.
            The exact same argument can be made for num == 3: the only possible
            split 1 * 2 is less than 3 itself, so just return 3.

        Otherwise, we have two options:

            Don't split the number up at all. We can initialize the answer as
            ans = num.

            Split the number. We can try all possible splits. Iterate i from 2
            until num. For each value of i, try to update ans with i * dp(num - i)
            if it is larger.

        You may be thinking: what about the constraint where we need to have at
        least 2 integers? We need to check for 2 separate cases before performing
        the recursion.

            If n == 2, we immediately return 1. The only possible split is 1 * 1.

            If n == 3, we immediately return 2. The only possible split is 1 * 2.

        We need to explicitly check for these cases before going into the recursion,
        otherwise, we would incorrectly return a larger answer since we initialize
        ans = num.

        For all other values of n, the recursion will work. Take a look at the first
        few numbers:

            For num = 4, we can do 2 * 2 = 4, which is not less than 4 itself.

            For num = 5, we can do 2 * 3 = 6, which is not less than 5 itself.

            For num = 6, we can do 3 * 3 = 9, which is not less than 6 itself.

        As you can see, as n increases, the product from splitting becomes larger
        and larger, and thus we will always satisfy the requirement of needing to
        perform at least one split. The only cases where performing a split results
        n a lower product is 2, 3.

        This solution will work, but you may notice that it will end up in a lot of
        duplicated computation. We will end up calculating many states multiple
        times. For example, if we called dp(15), it would make a call to dp(12)
        when calculating 3 * dp(12). If we later call dp(14), it will also make a
        call to dp(12) when calculating 2 * dp(12). To avoid computing the same
        states multiple times, we will use a technique called memoization. The first
        time we calculate dp(num), we will store the result. In the future, we can
        reference this result for num instead of having to recalculate it.

    def integerBreak_dp_bottom_up(self, num: int) -> int:

        Approach 2: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

        We can implement the same algorithm iteratively. In top-down, we start at
        the answer (num = n) and work our way down to the base cases (if num <= 3,
        return num).

        In bottom-up, we will start from these base cases and iterate toward the
        answer. We will use a table dp which is equivalent to the function from the
        previous approach. Here, dp[num] is equal to dp(num) from the previous
        approach.

        We have a for loop for num starting from 4 and iterating to n. Each
        iteration of this loop represents a state, like a function call. We can
        calculate this state the same way we did in the previous approach, by
        checking all possible splits with a for loop over i.

        """
        Approach 3: Mathematics

        Interestingly, it is optimal to only split n into 2 and 3! Why is this the
        case? The following is not a strict mathematical proof, but gives an
        intuition as to why we should only split n into 2 and 3.

        The "inequality of arithmetic and geometric means" shows that to maximize
        the product of a set of numbers with a fixed sum, the numbers should all be
        equal. This means that we should split n into a copies of x.

        We have: n = a * x. So, a = n / x

        The product of these copies will be x ^ a, we will substitute a = n / x and
        represent this function as f.

        f(x)= x ^ (n / x)

        We need to maximize this function. Let's start by taking the derivative of
        f with respect to x (here, log⁡ is the natural logarithm).

        f'(x) = -n * x ^ ((n / x) - 2) * (log x - 1)

        Now, we set this equal to 0 and solve for x to find a critical point.

        The term x ^ ((n / x) - 2) converges to 0 as x tends to 0. However, we are
        clearly not interested in values of x less than 1, as that would lead to a
        product less than 1.

        This means f = 0 when (log x - 1) = 0. This is the case when
        x = e = 2.71828...

        f is maximized at e. Unfortunately, e is not an integer, and this problem
        is called Integer Break. The nearest integer is 3, which suggests that we
        should try to use 3 as much as we can.

        For numbers that are not divisible by 3, we will have remainders. This is
        where 2 comes in. For example, when n = 11, the maximum product is
        54 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 2.

        When we have n = 4, it is better to split it into 2 * 2 versus 3 * 1. Thus,
        the strategy of splitting into as many 3s as we can only applies when n > 4.
        This brings us to our algorithm. As long as n > 4, keep splitting 3s. Once
        n <= 4, we can just multiply it directly with whatever product we have built
        up to that point.

        Note that due to the constraint of needing to perform at least one split, we
        still need to account for the special cases when n <= 3.

    def integerBreak_equation(self, num: int) -> int:
        """
        Approach 4: Equation

        Instead of manually multiplying by 3 repeatedly, we can use math to figure
        out how many 3s and 2s will make up the optimal product.

        First, we will again consider the cases when n <= 3 separately.

        Now, for n > 3, we have three possibilities:

            1. n % 3 == 0. If n is divisible by 3, then we can simply just break it
            into n / 3 3s.

            2. n % 3 == 1. If we were to break n into n / 3 3s, we would have a
            remainder of 1. As mentioned in the previous approach, it would be
            better to combine this 1 with one of the 3s to form a sum of 4, which we
            can break into 2 * 2. In this case, we break n into (n / 3) - 1  3s,
            and two 2s.

            3. n % 3 == 2. If we were to break n into n / 3 3s, we would have a
            remainder of 2. We simply break n into n / 3 3s and a single 2.
