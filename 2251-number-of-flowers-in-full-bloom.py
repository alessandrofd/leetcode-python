"""
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where
flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the ith flower will be in full bloom from
starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array
people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive
to see the flowers.

Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the number of
flowers that are in full bloom when the ith person arrives.

Constraints:
    1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 10^4
    flowers[i].length == 2
    1 <= starti <= endi <= 10^9
    1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4
    1 <= people[i] <= 10^9

Topics: Array, Hash Table, Binary Search, Sorting, Prefix Sum, Ordered Set

Hints:
    Notice that for any given time t, the number of flowers blooming at time t
    is equal to the number of flowers that have started blooming minus the
    number of flowers that have already stopped blooming.

    We can obtain these values efficiently using binary search.

    We can store the starting times in sorted order, which then allows us to
    binary search to find how many flowers have started blooming for a given
    time t.

    We do the same for the ending times to find how many flowers have stopped
    blooming at time t.

        Approach 1: Heap/Priority Queue

        For each person in people, we need to find how many flower ranges
        [start, end] contain person. An intuitive first step is to sort both input
        arrays so that we can process both flowers and people in chronological
        order.

        For the first person (in terms of arrival time), we can find all the
        flowers that have start less than person - these are the flowers that have
        started blooming before person arrived, and thus person might have a chance
        of seeing them. Of those flowers, we remove the ones that have end less
        than person as well, as these are the flowers that have finished blooming,
        and person missed them. The number of remaining flowers is the answer for
        the first person. Note that because we sorted people, the flowers we remove
        here are guaranteed never to be seen again and therefore will not affect
        anyone else after person.

        Let's move to the second person. Once again, we find all the flowers that
        have start less than person. But do we need to start from scratch? No!
        Because we are processing both the flowers and people in order, we can
        start from where we left off with the previous person. More specifically,
        because the second person's arrival time is greater than or equal to the
        previous person's, the flowers that bloom before the previous person must
        also bloom before the second person, so there's no need for us to handle
        this portion of flowers again. Therefore, we will add all the flowers that
        have start less than the second person, starting after the last flower we
        took.

        Similarly, the flowers that the previous person missed are definitely also
        missed by the second person, so there's no need for us to handle this
        portion of removed flowers again. Once we have taken all the flowers with
        start less than person, we can simply remove all the flowers that have end
        less than person. The number of remaining flowers is the answer for the
        econd person.

        We can continue this process for each person. To find the flowers with
        start less than a given person, we can use a pointer i that starts at 0.
        We will move i along the flowers array and never decrement or reset it.
        This allows us to pick up where we left off for each successive person.

        How can we remove the flowers that have end less than a given person?
        This one is trickier because we can only sort flowers by one dimension.
        To use the pointer technique we just described, we must sort by the start
        times. Thus, the end times are not necessarily in order. For example, you
        could have flowers like this:

            [2, 9], [3, 6]

        In this case, using another pointer like j for the end times would not work
        since 9 is greater than 6 but comes earlier in the input.

        As we are concerned with the flowers that have earlier end times, we can
        use a heap/priority queue to keep track of which flowers finish blooming.
        We will maintain a min heap and push end times of flowers onto this heap.
        Once we have added all flowers with start less than person, we will pop
        from the heap as long as the top of it is less than person.

        After popping from heap, it will hold the end times of all flowers that
        person can see. Thus, the answer for person is simply the size of the heap.

        To summarize, we use a pointer i to iterate along flowers. For a given
        person, we find all the flowers that started blooming before person arrives.
        We push the end time of these flowers onto a heap. We can then remove all
        the flowers that finished blooming by popping from the heap, since a min
        heap efficiently gives us the minimum (earliest) times.

        As we sort both input arrays, flowers that we pop from heap will never be
        seen again by future people.

        A note on implementation: here, we are sorting people, but the problem
        description asks us for the answer according to the original order. We will
        use a hash map that maps a person to the number of flowers they see.
        We will also keep the original order of people by creating a copy of it to
        sort. Once we have calculated the answer for everyone in the sorted order,
        we can iterate through the original people and refer to the hash map to
        build the final answer by restoring their original order.

        """
        There is a technique called difference array that can be used to solve many
        "range" based problems. The technique involves creating an array difference
        and iterating over all ranges [start, end]. We perform difference[start]++
        and difference[end + 1]-- for each range.

        The idea is that each index of difference represents the change in the
        number of flowers we can see when we cross this index (not the actual
        number of flowers on this index), with each index representing a unit of
        time. Thus, we could take a prefix sum of this difference array to find how
        many flowers can be seen at any given time with prefix[time].

        Some people also call this technique "line sweep".

        Unfortunately, if we look at the constraints, we find that values of
        start, end, people can be up to 10^9.

        It would not be feasible to create an array with such a large size. Thus,
        we need to use a map structure instead. Like in the previous approach, we
        still want to process everything chronologically. We will use the following
        data structures:

            In Java, we will use TreeMap.
            In C++, we will use std::map.
            In Python, we will use sortedcontainers.SortedDict.

        Note that if you were not allowed to use these structures in an interview,
        you could still implement this approach using a normal hash map. You would
        just need to sort the elements in the hash map by key values after you
        populated it.

        Once we have this data structure difference, we will follow the process
        described above. We iterate over each flower = [start, end] and increment
        difference[start] while decrementing difference[end + 1]. The idea is that
        when we reach start, the number of flowers we see increases by one. When we
        reach end + 1, the number of flowers we see decreases by one.

        We then create a prefix sum of the values in difference. We also need to
        know what time each value is associated with, so we will create an array
        positions to go along with our prefix array. Here, prefix[i] is the number
        of flowers available at time positions[i].

        Finally, we can iterate over people and find the answer for each person.
        How do we do this? We can perform a binary search over positions to find
        the index i where person fits. prefix[i] is the answer for this person.

        There are a few more things to consider before we start implementation.

            What happens if there is a person that arrives before any flower blooms?
            This may confuse our binary search since the minimum value in positions
            will be greater than person. We will initialize difference with 0: 0 to
            represent at time 0, we don't see any new flowers.

            Regarding the binary search; how should it be configured? Referencing
            the above example images, inserting 11 into the given positions array
            will put it at index 6. However, we need index 5. Thus, we need the
            insertion index minus one. What if the value exists in positions, as is
            the case with person = 7? To offset the minus one, we will binary search
            for the rightmost insertion index (bisect_right in Python,
            upper_bound in C++).

        In the previous approach, we used the concept of a difference array/line
        sweep to calculate how many flowers are seen at a given time. For each
        flower = [start, end], we indicated that at time start, we see one more
        flower, and at time end + 1, we see one less flower. We identified when a
        flower started blooming and when it finished blooming.

        The idea behind this strategy is that at any given time, the number of
        flowers we see is the number of flowers that have already started blooming
        minus the amount of flowers have finished blooming.

        Is there a simpler way to identify at a given time, how many flowers have
        started blooming, and how many flowers have finished blooming? In the first
        two approaches, we always associate the start and end of the same flower
        together for processing, which is more intuitive but can be more complex to
        handle. What if we separately consider these two sets of times?

        We can simply collect all start points in one array starts, sort it, and
        then perform a binary search. We can do the exact same thing with another
        array ends for all end points. Take a look at the following example:

        Regarding the binary searches: when binary searching on starts, we want to
        search for the rightmost insertion index. This is because if a person
        arrives at the same time as a flower starts blooming, we want to include
        this flower.

        Note that a flower = [start, end] stops blooming at end + 1, not end.
        There are two ways we can handle this. We can either binary search on end
        for the leftmost insertion index (since we want to include all flowers with
        end equal to the current time), or we can assemble ends using end + 1 for
        each flower. We will implement the algorithm using the second option in
        this article.
