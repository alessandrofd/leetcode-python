        Approach 2: String Concatenation/Rotation

        Consider a string S = "helloworld". Now, given another string
        T = "lloworldhe", can we figure out if T is a rotated version of S? By
        rotated version, we mean taking S and shifting it any number of spaces
        (with wrap around). For example, if S = "abc" and we shifted it to the left
        once, we would have "bca".

        Yes, we check if T is a rotated version of S by checking if it is a substring
        of S + S. This is because S + S contains all of the rotations of S.

        Let's try to use this fact to solve our problem.

        We consider every rotation of string S such that it's rotated by k units
        (where k < s.length) to the left. Specifically, we're looking at strings
        elloworldh, lloworldhe, loworldhel, etc.

        If a string can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending
        multiple copies of the substring together, IT MUST BE A ROTATION OF ITSELF.
        However, it would be inefficient to check all rotations.

        Let t = s + s. We can easily and efficiently check all possible rotations by
        removing the first and last character of t, then checking if s is a substring
        of t.

        OBS: Na verdade, removemos o primeiro e o último caracter para garantir que
        haja uma repetição de subtring. Caso contrário, a string original, sem
        qualquer rotação, passaria pela verificação.

        We can prove that the solution works mathematically.

        Let's assume s = p * k where p is a pattern that has been repeated k times.
        If there is no repeating pattern in s, k would be 1 and p = s. If there is a
        repeating pattern, then k > 1.

        If we concatenate s twice, i.e., form another string t where t = s + s and
        remove the first and last character from it, t would look like
        t = (head + p * (k - 1)) + (p * (k - 1) + tail) where head is p without first
        character, tail is p without last character and p * (k - 1) denotes p
        repeated k - 1 times.

        As a result, t = head + p * (2k - 2) + tail. We now have 2 possibilities:
        either k = 1 and the answer is false, or k > 1 and the answer is true.

        If k = 1, then 2k - 2 = 0 and t = head + tail. Remember, head is equal to p
        with the first character removed, and tail is equal to p with the last
        character removed. We can simplify this as t is equal to p + p with the first
        and last characters removed. Now, s cannot possibly be a substring of t
        because s = p and we removed the first and last character.

        => Thus, if k = 1, then s cannot be a substring of t and the answer is false

        If k > 1, then 2k - 2 is some nonzero integer x. This means
        t = head + p * x + tail. By definition, s = p * k. This means that as long as
        x >= k, s must be contained within p * x, and thus within t. We have
        x = 2k - 2, so the inequality becomes 2k - 2 >= k. We can rearrange this to
        k >= 2, which is the same thing as k > 1.

        => In conclusion, if k > 1, it implies two things: first, the answer to the
        problem is true. Second, x >= k and thus s must be a substring of p * x, and
        thus a substring of t.

        So, concatenate s twice and then remove the first and last characters from
        it. The answer to the problem is the answer to "does this new string contain
        s as a substring"?

        OBS: Apesar do potencial de complexidade O(n), a forma como os algoritmos de
        busca em string são implementados eleveam a complexidade para O(n^2). A
        sugestão é aplicar o algoritmos de Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP).
