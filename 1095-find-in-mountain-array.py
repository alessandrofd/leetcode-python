You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

    arr.length >= 3

    There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
        arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
        arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]

Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that
mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array
using a MountainArray interface:

    MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k
    (0-indexed).

    MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged
Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will
result in disqualification.

Constraints:
    3 <= mountain_arr.length() <= 10^4
    0 <= target <= 10^9
    0 <= mountain_arr.get(index) <= 10^9

OVERVIEW 

We are given a mountain array. Based on the definition given in the problem 
description, any mountain array, can in general be represented as a strictly 
increasing array followed by a strictly decreasing array.

The problem asks us to find the (minimum) index of a given target element in 
the given mountainArr. There might be a case where the target element is not 
present in the mountainArr. In such a case, we need to return -1.

Before moving further, let's focus on the term minimum index. Is there a 
possibility of multiple occurrences of the target element in the mountainArr?

Due to the phrase strictly in definition, it may seem that there is no 
possibility of multiple occurrences of any element. However, further thought 
on the graph suggests that corresponding to any element, there can be at most 
two occurrences of the element, one in the strictly increasing array and the 
other in the strictly decreasing array.Or one before the peak and the other 
after the peak.

In such a case, we should return the index of the element in the strictly 
increasing array. If the element is not present in the strictly increasing 
array, then we should return the index of the element in the strictly 
decreasing array.

Like any other array search problem, the Linear Search may sound very natural.

However, we cannot access the element of the given mountainArr directly. 
To access the element at index k, we need to call the function 
mountainArr.get(k).

Still, we can call get for indices varying from 0 to mountainArr.length() - 1, 
and find the index of the target element.

However, there is a catch. The problem description also mentions that the 
function mountainArr.get(k) will be called at most 100 times, but the size of 
the mountainArr can be as large as 10000.

Thus, Linear Search will not work here!

Recall that when search space is sorted, we can use Binary Search to find the 
element in O(log⁡2 N) time complexity, where N is the size of the search space.

In a sorted array, examination of only O(log⁡2 N) elements is sufficient to 
search an element, or O(log⁡2 N)calls to the get function is sufficient to 
find the element.

Taking the upper bound of the length of the mountainArr as 10000, we can say 
that around 14 calls to get(k) will be sufficient to find the target element 
if array was sorted. However, mountainArr is not exactly sorted.

    It has a peak element peak at index peakIndex.

        Finding the peakIndex in the mountainArr is another algorithmic 
        problem. Readers are strongly advised to solve the problem Peak Index 
        in a Mountain Array before proceeding further.

        After solving, readers can appreciate that the peakIndex can be found 
        in O(log⁡2 N) time complexity.

        However, it is worth noting that although the time complexity of 
        finding peakIndex is O(log⁡2 N), at each step, we need to examine at 
        least two neighboring elements. Hence, the number of calls to get(k) 
        will be around 2 * log⁡2 N2.

    The array is strictly increasing from index 0 to peakIndex. Thus, we can 
    use Binary Search to find the target element in the range [0, peakIndex].

        The time complexity of Binary Search is O(log⁡2 N). For searching, at 
        each step, we need to examine only one element. Hence, the number of 
        calls to get(k) will be around log⁡2 N.

    The array is strictly decreasing from index peakIndex + 1 to 
    mountainArr.length() - 1. Thus, we can use Binary Search to find the 
    target element in the range [peakIndex + 1, mountainArr.length() - 1].

        The time complexity of Binary Search is O(log⁡2 N). For searching, at 
        each step, we need to examine only one element. Hence, the number of 
        calls to get(k) will be around log⁡2 N.

    Hence, by using Binary Search thrice, and by making about 4 * log⁡2 N calls to 
    get(k), we can find the target element in the mountainArr.

    Will the number of calls to mountainArr.get(k) be less than 100?
    In the worst case, there will be about 4 * log⁡2 N calls to mountainArr.get(k). 
    Taking the upper bound of the length of the mountainArr as 10000, we can say 
    that Binary Search will take around 56 calls to get(k). Thus, the number of 
    calls to get(k) will be less than 100.

        As discussed in Overview, we will break the problem into three parts, but
        before doing that, readers should keep in mind the following fact of Binary
        Search

            In Binary Search, we discard half of the search space at each step,
            based on the test condition on the middle element of the search space.

            We must ensure that we don't end up discarding the element we are
            looking for. Our [low, high] search space must always contain the
            element we are looking for.

        1. FIND INDEX OF PEAK ELEMENT

        What's the possible range of peakIndex?

        Looking at the problem description, we are sure that index-0 and
        index-mountainArr.length() - 1 are not the peak indices. Hence, the lowest
        possible value of peakIndex is 1, and the highest possible value of
        peakIndex is mountainArr.length() - 2.

        Hence, we can set
            low = 1
            high = mountainArr.length() - 2

        testIndex will be the middle index of the search space [low, high].

        How to test if testIndex is the peakIndex?

        Element at peakIndex is greater than its neighbors. However, this would
        require 3 calls to mountainArr.get(k). We can do better.

        Let's compare the element at testIndex with its right neighbor only

        We can have three markers on the graph
            i for arbitrary index at strictly increasing part of the array
            d for arbitrary index at strictly decreasing part of the array
            p for the peakIndex

            For all i, we have mountainArr.get(i) < mountainArr.get(i + 1).
            For all d, we have mountainArr.get(d) > mountainArr.get(d + 1).
            For p, we have mountainArr.get(p) > mountainArr.get(p + 1).

        Thus,
            if mountainArr.get(testIndex) < mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1), then
            testIndex is i only.

        In this case, we can discard the left half of the search space, and search
        in the right half of the search space. This can be done by setting
        low = testIndex + 1. The testIndex was not at all a candidate for peakIndex.
        Hence, by discarding the left half of the search space, we are not
        discarding the peakIndex.

            the case mountainArr.get(testIndex) == mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1) is
            not possible.

            if mountainArr.get(testIndex) > mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1), then
            testIndex is either d or p.

        In this case, we can discard the right half of the search space, and search
        in the left half of the search space. This can be done by setting
        high = testIndex. We cannot discard testIndex as it is a candidate for
        peakIndex. Hence, by setting high = testIndex, we are not discarding
        candidates for peakIndex.

        Note that failure of the first if condition (mountainArr.get(testIndex) <
        mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1)) implies passing of this if condition
        (mountainArr.get(testIndex) > mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1)). Hence, we
        can use else instead of the if condition. This will prevent unnecessary
        comparison calls to get.

        When to stop the search?

        The discarding of search space is done in such a way that the peakIndex is
        always present in the search space. A quick check of the above algorithm
        shows that the search space will be reduced to a single element, i.e.
        low == high.

        Assume search space reduces to three element array [f, g, h]. It's worth
        noting that [f, g, h] is not the input array, but the reduced search space.
        The testIndex will be the index of g.

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) < mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1), then in the
        next iteration, the search space will reduce to a single element [h].

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) > mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1), then in the
        next iteration, the search space will reduce to [f, g].

        Let's see what happens when search space reduces to an array [f, g] with
        only two elements. It's worth noting that [f, g] is not the input array.
        In fact, mountainArr needs to have at least 3 elements. The [f, g] is
        reduced search space. The testIndex will be the index of f.

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) < mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1), then in the
        next iteration, the search space will reduce to a single element [g].

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) > mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1), then in the
        next iteration, the search space will reduce to a single element [f].

        Thus, every two-element search space will be reduced to a single-element
        search space. We can prove by induction that every search space reduces to
        a single-element search space.

        Hence, we can stop the search when low == high. In this case, low (which is
        equal to high) will be the peakIndex.

        2. SEARCH IN STRICTLY INCREASING PART OF THE ARRAY

        We will first search in the strictly increasing part of the array because
        if target exists, we need to return the minimum index of the target element.
        The minimum index of the target element will be in the strictly increasing
        part of the array.

        If we fail to find the target element in the strictly increasing part of
        the array, then we will search in the strictly decreasing part of the array.

        WHAT'S THE POSSIBLE RANGE OF TARGETINDEX IN THE STRICTLY INCREASING PART OF
        THE ARRAY?

        The targetIndex will be in the range [0, peakIndex]. Hence, we can set
            low = 0
            high = peakIndex

        Both are inclusive. testIndex will be the middle index of the search space
        [low, high].

        HOW TO TEST IF TESTINDEX IS THE TARGETINDEX?

            The array is strictly increasing.

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) < target, then we are sure that all elements
        at indices less than or equal to testIndex are less than target. Hence, we
        can discard the left half of the search space, and search in the right half
        of the search space. This can be done by setting low = testIndex + 1. The
        testIndex was not at all a candidate for targetIndex. Hence, by discarding
        the left half of the search space, we are not discarding the targetIndex.

        Otherwise, it means mountainArr.get(testIndex) >= target, then we are sure
        that all elements at indices greater than testIndex are greater than or
        equal to target. Here, we can discard the right half of the search space,
        and search in the left half of the search space. This can be done by
        setting high = testIndex. We cannot discard testIndex as it is a candidate
        for targetIndex. Hence, by setting high = testIndex, we are not discarding
        candidates for targetIndex.

        WHEN TO STOP THE SEARCH?

        The discarding of search space is done in such a way that the candidate for
        targetIndex is always present in the search space. A quick check of the
        above algorithm shows that the search space will be reduced to a single
        element, i.e. low == high.

        Hence, we can stop the search when low == high. In this case, low (which is
        equal to high) is the only candidate for targetIndex in the strictly
        increasing part of the array.

        WHAT IF TARGET IS NOT PRESENT IN THE STRICTLY INCREASING PART OF THE ARRAY?

        low was the only candidate for targetIndex in the strictly increasing part
        of the array.

        If mountainArr.get(low) == target, then low is the targetIndex. Hence, we
        will return low.

        Otherwise, if mountainArr.get(low) != target, then target is not present in
        the strictly increasing part of the array. In this case, we will search in
        the strictly decreasing part of the array.

        3. SEARCH IN STRICTLY DECREASING PART OF THE ARRAY

        If target is not present in the strictly increasing part of the array, then
        we will search in the strictly decreasing part of the array. If we fail to
        find the target element in the strictly decreasing part of the array, then
        we will return -1.

        WHAT'S THE POSSIBLE RANGE OF TARGETINDEX IN THE STRICTLY DECREASING PART OF
        THE ARRAY?

        The targetIndex will be in the range [peakIndex + 1, mountainArr.length() - 1].
        Hence, we can set
            low = peakIndex + 1
            high = mountainArr.length() - 1

        Both are inclusive. testIndex will be the middle index of the search space
        [low, high].

        HOW TO TEST IF TESTINDEX IS THE TARGETINDEX?

        The array is strictly decreasing.

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) > target, then we are sure that all elements
        at indices less than or equal to testIndex are greater than target. Hence,
        we can discard the left half of the search space, and search in the right
        half of the search space. This can be done by setting low = testIndex + 1.
        The testIndex was not at all a candidate for targetIndex. Hence, by
        discarding the left half of the search space, we are not discarding the
        targetIndex.

        Otherwise, it means mountainArr.get(testIndex) <= target, then we are sure
        that all elements at indices greater than testIndex are less than or equal
        to target. Here, we can discard the right half of the search space, and
        search in the left half of the search space. This can be done by setting
        high = testIndex. We cannot discard testIndex as it is a candidate for
        targetIndex. Hence, by setting high = testIndex, we are not discarding the
        candidate for targetIndex.

        WHEN TO STOP THE SEARCH?

        The discarding of search space is done in such a way that the candidate for
        targetIndex is always present in the search space. A quick check of the
        above algorithm shows that the search space will be reduced to a single
        element, i.e. low == high.

        Hence, we can stop the search when low == high. In this case, low (which is
        equal to high) is the only candidate for targetIndex in the strictly
        decreasing part of the array.

        WHAT IF TARGET IS NOT PRESENT IN THE STRICTLY DECREASING PART OF THE ARRAY?

        low was the only candidate for targetIndex in the strictly decreasing part
        of the array.

        If mountainArr.get(low) == target, then low is the targetIndex. Hence, we
        will return low.

        Otherwise, if mountainArr.get(low) != target, then target is not present in
        the strictly decreasing part of the array. Searching in the strictly
        decreasing part of the array implies that target was not present in the
        strictly increasing part of the array. Hence, target is not present in the
        mountainArr. In this case, we will return -1.

        Hence, by breaking the problem into three parts, we can find the target
        element in the mountainArr.

        The testIndex is the middle value of the search space [low, high]. Now,
        testIndex = (low + high) / 2 is a natural way to find the middle value of
        the search space. However, this can cause overflow. Hence, many often use
        the formula testIndex = low + (high - low) / 2.

        In our problem, high and low can be at most 10000. Thus, low + high, will
        probably not cause overflow. Hence, we can use sum.

        Approach 2: Minimizing get Calls with Early Stopping and Caching

        The purpose of Approach 1 was to slowly build the intuition for the problem.
        Therefore, the three parts of the problem contain several redundant steps.

        In this approach, we will avoid redundant work that will minimize the
        number of calls to mountainArr.get(k). In addition, we will look at the
        "caching" technique that can accomplish the task more efficiently.

        We are examining 2 * log⁡N 2 elements for finding peakIndex. What if while
        examining an element at index testIndex, we came to know that element is
        equal to target itself? Can we immediately return testIndex as the
        targetIndex?

        Not every time! In the problem, we want to return the minimum index of the
        target element. Hence, we can do so only when we are sure that the element
        at index testIndex is in the strictly increasing part of the array. If the
        element at index testIndex is in the strictly decreasing part of the array,
        then we aren't sure if it is the minimum index of the target element.

        For search in strictly increasing (and after that strictly decreasing)
        part, if we came to know that element at testIndex is equal to target, then
        there we can immediately return the testIndex as targetIndex. However, here
        is a word of caution.

        Let's take the example of the strictly increasing portion.

        if mountainArr.get(testIndex) == target, then we can return testIndex as
        targetIndex.

        if mountainArr.get(testIndex) < target, then we can set
        low = testIndex + 1.

        if mountainArr.get(testIndex) > target, then we can set
        high = testIndex - 1. Because we know that testIndex is no longer a
        candidate for targetIndex. In Approach-1, we were setting high = testIndex
        because it was a potential candidate. The condition there was
        mountainArr.get(testIndex) >= target. Here, the condition is
        mountainArr.get(testIndex) > target. Hence, we can set high = testIndex - 1.

        Now, this may seem like no issue, but there are chances that low and high
        don't converge to a single element.

        Take for example a two array search space [f, g].
        low will be the index of f.
        high will be the index of g.
        testIndex will be the index of f.

        Now, if mountainArr.get(testIndex) > target, then we will set
        high = testIndex - 1. This will make the high point to f - 1. However, low
        will still point to f. Hence, the search space will be [f, f - 1]. This is
        not a valid search space.

        Thus, the condition of the stop of the search will be low > high, and while
        loop condition will be low <= high.

        We computed testIndex as testIndex = (low + high) / 2. The floor division
        by 2 can be computed by right shift by 1. Hence, we can compute testIndex
        as testIndex = (low + high) >> 1.

        In strictly increasing (or strictly decreasing) subarray, we are doing
        Binary Search. Turns out that we can also do a Ternary Search, by reducing
        search space to one-third at each iteration. Will it reduce the number of
        calls to mountainArr.get(k)? Let's see.

        The number of iterations in ternary search will be O(log⁡3 N). The reason is
        that at each iteration, the search space is reduced to one-third. Now at
        each iteration, we need to examine two indices, testIndex1 and testIndex2.
        Thus, the number of calls to mountainArr.get(k) will be 2 * log⁡3 N.

        Using the base change formula,
        = 2 * log⁡3 N
        = 2 * (log⁡2 N / log⁡2 3)
        = 2 * (log⁡2 N / 1.585)
        = 1.26 * log⁡2 N

        The number of calls to mountainArr.get(k) in Binary Search is log⁡2 N.

        Thus, ternary search provides less number of iterations, but more number of
        calls to mountainArr.get(k). Hence, we will stick to Binary Search.

        The above ideas sound good. Let's see one more idea.

        In complexity analysis of Approach 1, we assumed that each call to
        mountainArr.get(k) takes O(1) time. However, we don't know the time
        complexity of mountainArr.get(k). What if calls to the get() API are very
        expensive? We certainly need to minimize function calls as much as we can.

        Assume get() was retrieving data from a huge database that is on the other
        side of the world. One would appreciate our algorithm finishing faster,
        even if that difference is constant.

        Assume an element at index i in the strictly increasing part of the array,
        and we called get(i) while computing the peakIndex. Now, we are searching
        for target in the strictly increasing part of the array. We might again
        need to call get(i) while searching for target. Is it truly a better idea
        to call get(i) twice?

        We perhaps can cache the values of mountainArr.get(k) in an array, or
        perhaps in a Hash Map. This will increase the space complexity. However, we
        won't be calling mountainArr.get(k) twice. Before calling
        mountainArr.get(k), we will check if the value is already cached. If it is,
        then we will use the cached value. Otherwise, we will call
        mountainArr.get(k) and cache the value.

        This parallels the way web browsers store data. Often, the expense
        associated with reacquiring a page is considered to be greater than that of
        storing it in a cache.

        Briefly, the following major modifications will be done in three parts.

        FINDING peakIndex

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) is in the cache, then use the cached value.
        Otherwise, call mountainArr.get(testIndex) and cache the value. Call this
        as curr. If curr == target, check if it is in the strictly increasing part
        of the array. If it is, then return testIndex as targetIndex. Otherwise,
        continue the search for peakIndex.

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1) is in the cache, then use the cached
        value. Otherwise, call mountainArr.get(testIndex + 1) and cache the value.
        Call this next. If next == target, check if it is in the strictly
        increasing part of the array. If it is, then return testIndex + 1 as
        targetIndex. Otherwise, continue the search for peakIndex.

        SEARCH IN STRICTLY INCREASING PART OF THE ARRAY

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) is in the cache, then use the cached value.

        Otherwise, call mountainArr.get(testIndex). Note that we don't need to
        cache the value of mountainArr.get(testIndex) as this is the last time we
        need to access this value. Call this as curr. If curr == target, then
        return testIndex as targetIndex.

        SEARCH IN STRICTLY DECREASING PART OF THE ARRAY

        If mountainArr.get(testIndex) is in the cache, then use the cached value.
        Call it curr. If curr == target, then return testIndex as targetIndex.
        We perhaps didn't return in the first while loop because it was in the
        strictly decreasing part of the array.

        Otherwise, call mountainArr.get(testIndex). Note that we don't need to
        cache the value of mountainArr.get(testIndex) as this is the last time we
        need to access this value. Call this as curr. If curr == target, then
        return testIndex as targetIndex.

        A quick note on how to cache the values of mountainArr.get(k).

        We can use an array of size mountainArr.length() to cache the values of
        mountainArr.get(k). The index of the array will be the index of the
        mountainArr. The value at the index will be the value of mountainArr.get(k).
        This will increase the space complexity by O(N). However, is it a truly
        good idea? There will be many indices in the array that will not be used
        because we will call mountainArr.get(k) only for 4 * log⁡ N indices. Hence,
        we will be wasting space.

        Therefore, use a Hash Map which gives constant time lookups. The key of the
        Hash Map will be the index of the mountainArr. The value at the key will be
        the value of mountainArr.get(k). This will increase the space complexity by
        O(log ⁡N) reducing it from previously proposed O(N). The reduction of this
        space complexity is significant.
