The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.

At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending
at any place and will cover the original existing characters.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to
print it.

Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s consists of lowercase English letters.


OVERVIEW 

In this article, we will denote the ith character of the string s as si, and 
the substring from the lth to the rt character (inclusive) as sl..r

    Let s = leetcode. Then s4 = c, s7 = e, s4..7 = code.

One can represent each strange printer operation with a triplet (c, l, r)
meaning that it prints the character c over the substring sl..r.

Consider two examples.

    When one needs to print s = aba, the first step is to print aaa (3 
    occurrences of a) and then transform it into aba in one operation.

    To print leetcode, we first print eeeeeeee (8 occurrences of e) and then 
    transform it into leetcode: eeeeeeee → leeeeeee → leeteeee → leetceee → 
    leetcoee → leetcode.

Take a closer look at the sequences of operations in these two examples. 
For all operations (c, l, r), c = sr holds.

In the first example, we have s = aba and the operations:

    (a, 0, 2) prints the character a over the entire string s. Here we have 
    c = a, l = 0, r = 2. The character c = a equals sr = s2 = a.

    (b, 1, 1) prints b at the index 1 (the range of this operation contains 
    only one position). Again, c = b equals s1 = b.

In the second example, s = leetcode. The operations are:

    (e, 0, 7) prints the character c =s7 = e over the entire string s.

    (l, 0, 0) prints c = s0 = l at the index 0.

    (t, 3, 3) prints c = s3 = t at the index 3.

    (c, 4, 4) prints c = s4 = c at the index 4.

    (o, 5, 5) prints c = s5 = o at the index 5.

    (d, 6, 6) prints c = s6 = d at the index 6.

Now, we want to prove the following lemma.

    Lemma. There exists at least one optimal sequence, where for each 
    operation (c, l, r), c = sr holds.

Proof. Consider an optimal answer (with the minimum number of operations) not 
satisfying the condition, i.e. containing a "bad" operation (c, l, r) with 
c != sr. Immediately after this operation, the character at the rth position 
is c, but in the end, it must be sr, meaning that printing c at the rth 
position was useless. Thus one can safely replace the operation (c, l, r) 
with (c, l, r - 1). Note, that (c, l, r - 1) might still be "bad", i.e. 
satisfying c != sr-1.

One can replace "bad" operations (c, l, r) with (c, l, r - 1) iteratively 
until there are no more "bad" operations in the sequence. At the end of this 
iterative process, each triplet (c, l, r) will satisfy c = sr. Since the new 
sequence remains optimal (the number of operations did not increase), we have 
proved the lemma.

We will seek a solution to the problem among the sequences satisfying the 
condition in the lemma.

INTUITION

To solve the problem, we break it down into smaller subproblems. One way to
do this is to consider all possible substrings of the input string and find
the minimum number of operations required to print each substring using the
strange printer.

Given a pair of indices (l, r), consider a string t of length r - l + 1 that
only has the character sr.

Let dp[l][r] be the minimum number of operations needed to transform t into
the substring sl..r. Notice how this dp definition is based on choosing to
print on the indices [l, r], and then figuring out how many operations will
be needed after.

    For example, let s = leetcode.
        dp[1][5] = 3 is the number of operations to transform ooooo into eetco.
        dp[4][7] = 3 is the answer for transforming eeee into code.

The base cases of this DP are the substrings entirely consisting of the same
character. For such of these substrings, dp[l][r] = 0, since one does not
have to do any operations.

    For example, for s = leetcode, dp[1][2] = 0, because transforming ee into
    ee requires 0 operations.

Now we need to write down the transitions for this DP.

Consider a substring sl..r containing at least two distinct characters. Let j
be the leftmost index such that j ≥ l and sj != sr (the first character in
the range that doesn't equal the last character in the range).

We want to transform the string of r - l + 1 occurrences of sr into sl..r.
Since sj != sr, we will eventually have to change the character at the jth
position by printing another character over it. The characters in the
substring sl..j-1 are all equal to sr (based on how we defined j), so we will
not worry about them anymore for the rest of the algorithm. Now, we focus on
the range [j, r].

Consider the first operation that prints at the position j. We know that we
start printing at position j, but we do not know where we end. Let's call the
ending position i so that the operation is (si, j, i).

Let's see what happens for a fixed i.

    With the operation (si, j, i) we print the character si over the substring
    sj..i. After that, the problem reduces to two independent smaller problems.

    Now the segment sj..i contains j - i + 1 occurrences of si. By definition
    of DP, it takes dp[j][i] operations to "fix" this segment.

    The segment si+1..r contains r - i occurrences of sr (remember that
    originally, we have [l, r] all equal to sr, and we didn't override the
    range [i + 1, r] with the operation (si, j, i). Similarly, it takes
    dp[i+1][r] operations to "fix" it.

For a fixed i, the answer is 1+ dp[j][i] + dp[i+1][r]. To find dp[l][r], we
first find j according to how we defined it above, then we try all possible
j <= i < r and take the minimum value from the recurrence just defined.

The length of the substring sl..r is r - l + 1, we will denote it length.
Since length = r - l + 1, thus r = l + length - 1.

Since we calculate the value of dp for larger substrings via the smaller
ones, we need to compute dp for strings in ascending order of their length:
first consider the substrings having length = 1, then length = 2, etc.

Now we need to find the answer to the problem using DP.

Let n be the size of s.

Our first operation should always be to print the final character of s
n times. Then, we transform this string into ss in dp[0][n - 1] operations.
We need to start with this print operation because of the lemma we proved
before; it is the only way we can get the last character printed optimally.

The answer to the problem is dp[0][n - 1] + 1. The +1 is due to the first
print operation which is not considered in the DP.
